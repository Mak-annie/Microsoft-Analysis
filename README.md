#### Introduction
Major firms are creating an increasing amount of unique video content for the entertainment market, grabbing the interest of viewers everywhere. Microsoft has strategically decided to enter the film industry by launching its own movie studio, motivated by this trend. Microsoft, however, finds it difficult to comprehend the essential elements that contribute to the box office success of movies due to a lack of prior industry expertise. This initiative intends to use exploratory data analysis to pinpoint the categories of movies that are currently performing extraordinarily well, offering useful information to help Microsoft's new film studio make wise choices.

## Problem Statement
Microsoft's inexperience in the movie-making industry is a major barrier to the success of their recently launched movie studio. The current challenge is to identify the traits and categories of movies that have enjoyed significant box office success. The idea is to provide the head of Microsoft's movie studio with the knowledge needed to choose the kinds of movies to make, increasing the likelihood of success.

## Main Objective
To perform exploratory data analysis in order to learn more about the kinds of movies that are currently doing well at the box office

## Specific Objectives

## Data Understanding
The project will utilize datasets that consist of details regarding film box office earnings, encompassing factors such as release dates, genres, budgets, ratings, production studios and revenue.

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset,explorative data analysis techniques will be employed.These techniques involve addressing missing values, veryfing data types, identifying duplicated and extracting pertinent features for analysis

## Methodology
In this project, data analysis and visualization techniques in Python, utilizing libraries such as pandas and matplotlib,will be employed.

The available dataset will be examined through analysis and visualizations.This process will help identify key relationships and trends, enabling the extraction of insights related to office performance.
## Data Wrangling
Only a few features and rows from the various datasets that were gathered are important to the procedure. As a result, in this stage, the features from each dataset that were not necessary were removed. After then, the remaining datasets were connected.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In this project, data visualizations were used to explore this data and aid in coming up with recommendations for one of the ways Microsoft could begin its journey in the movie industry.

## Conclusions
-The recognition of popular genres.

-The relationship between spending and profits at the box office, seasonal patterns that affect the popularity of movies.

-Elements that contribute to audience contentment and favorable reviews.

## Recommendations
-Focus on making movies in genres that have a track record of success and fit with Microsoft's brand and target audience's tastes.

-Budget Allocation: Based on an investigation of the correlation between production budgets and box office results, optimize the budget allocation.

-Release Strategy: Using seasonal trends and market factors, pinpoint advantageous release dates and times that historically generate higher box office receipts.

-Focus on Content: Adapt the films' narratives to reflect the elements that have been found to increase viewer satisfaction, such as interesting plots, compelling characters, and creative storytelling methods.
